class Main{//Serves as the entry point to our program 
    public static void main(String[]args){//ok so when we write this line this line means that this is the main method we can create many methods like this This will run by default you can suppose like jvm is programmed in such a way that when a program is run it looks for a static method named main with public access and takes an array of string as parameter which doesnt return a value so if we do the same thing for another class we get two main classes in the program and have to specify which to run
        System.out.println("Hello World");//print(ln) works as a new line character like /n in python
        System.out.print("Hello Java");// we can use only print if we dont want the next print statement in the next line
        
    }
}
class Tida{
    public static void main(String[]args){
        System.out.print("Hello duniya");

    }
}
